# Character Avatar Feature - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the character avatar feature as requested by @Crazy-Rain. The bot's profile picture now automatically updates to match the character's avatar when a character is loaded.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Web Interface Changes

- Visual confirmation message: "✨ Updated bot avatar to match [Character Name]"

### 3. Character Card Format
- All character cards now include an `avatar_url` field (optional)
- Backward compatible - existing cards work fine with empty avatar_url

### 4. Error Handling

## Technical Details

### Avatar Update Process
1. User sets `avatar_url` in character card
2. When character is loaded, bot checks for `avatar_url`
3. If present, bot downloads image using aiohttp
4. Image bytes are passed to Discord API: `bot.user.edit(avatar=bytes)`
5. Bot's profile picture updates globally across all servers

### Rate Limiting
- Discord allows maximum 2 avatar changes per hour
- Bot handles rate limit errors gracefully
- Users should plan character switches accordingly

### Image Requirements
- **Format**: PNG, JPG, or GIF
- **Size**: Maximum 10MB
- **Recommended**: 256x256 or larger (square images)
- **URL**: Must be publicly accessible direct link

### Scope
- Avatar change is **global** (affects all servers)
- Different from nickname which is per-server
- No special permissions required (bot owner can always change avatar)

## Usage Example

### Web Interface
```
1. Navigate to http://localhost:5000
2. Go to "Characters" tab
3. Edit or create a character
4. In "Avatar URL" field, enter: https://i.imgur.com/example.png
5. Click "Save Character"
```

### Discord
```
User: !character luna
Bot:  Loaded character: luna
Bot:  ✨ Updated bot avatar to match Luna

[Bot's profile picture changes to Luna's avatar]
```

## Testing

- ✓ Existing functionality unchanged
- ✓ Character cards support avatar_url field
- ✓ Web interface saves and loads avatar URLs correctly
- ✓ Bot has method to update avatar from URL

## Benefits

2. **Visual Identity**: Easy to see which character is currently active
3. **Professional Appearance**: Branded avatars for different character personas
4. **Flexible**: Optional feature - works fine without avatar URLs
5. **Easy to Use**: Simple URL input in web interface
