# Character Name and Avatar Fix - Summary

## Issue Description

Users reported that when loading characters, the Discord bot wasn't displaying the character's name or avatar properly. Instead, it was showing the bot's default name and avatar.

## Root Cause

The problem was in the `send_as_character()` method in `discord_bot.py`. When a character card has an empty `avatar_url` field (empty string `""`), the code was passing this empty string to Discord's webhook API:

```python
# OLD CODE (PROBLEMATIC)
await webhook.send(
    content=content,
    username=character_name,
    avatar_url=avatar_url,  # This was "" (empty string)
    wait=True
)
```

When Discord's webhook API receives an empty string for `avatar_url`, it treats this as invalid and falls back to the webhook's default settings - which includes using the bot's name and avatar instead of the custom character name.

## Solution

The fix conditionally includes the `avatar_url` parameter only when it has a valid non-empty value:

```python
# NEW CODE (FIXED)
# Build webhook parameters
webhook_params = {
    'username': character_name,
    'wait': True
}

# Only include avatar_url if it's a valid non-empty string
if avatar_url and avatar_url.strip():
    webhook_params['avatar_url'] = avatar_url

# Send with conditional parameters
await webhook.send(
    content=content,
    **webhook_params
)
```

## Behavior

### Before Fix
- Character with `avatar_url: ""` → Bot displays its own name and avatar
- Character with `avatar_url: "https://..."` → Character name and avatar display correctly

### After Fix
- Character with `avatar_url: ""` → Character name displays correctly (no avatar)
- Character with `avatar_url: None` → Character name displays correctly (no avatar)
- Character with `avatar_url: "   "` → Character name displays correctly (no avatar)
- Character with `avatar_url: "https://..."` → Character name and avatar display correctly

## Files Modified

1. **discord_bot.py**
   - Modified `send_as_character()` method (lines 176-185)
   - Added conditional parameter building logic

2. **test_per_channel_avatars.py**
   - Updated test assertions to match new implementation

3. **test_webhook_avatar_fix.py** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive test suite for the fix
   - Tests all edge cases (empty, None, whitespace, valid URLs)

## Testing

All tests pass:
- ✓ Webhook parameter building works correctly
- ✓ Code structure is correct
- ✓ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✓ Character names display even without avatars
- ✓ Valid avatar URLs still work properly

## User Impact

**Positive:**
- Character names now display correctly in webhook messages
- Characters without avatars still show their custom name
- More graceful handling of missing avatar URLs

**No Breaking Changes:**
- Existing character cards continue to work
- Characters with valid avatar URLs work exactly as before
- All existing functionality preserved

## Discord API Behavior

This fix works around a quirk in Discord's webhook API:
- Empty string `avatar_url` → Discord ignores custom username
- Missing `avatar_url` parameter → Discord uses custom username
- Valid `avatar_url` → Discord uses both custom username and avatar

Our fix ensures we only pass `avatar_url` when it's valid, allowing the custom username to always work.
