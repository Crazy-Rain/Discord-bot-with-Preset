# Character-Linked Lorebook Feature - Complete (Multi-Character Support)

## Summary

Successfully implemented the ability to link lorebooks to specific AI characters, **now with support for multiple characters per lorebook**. This feature allows users to organize lore more effectively and have character-specific information automatically activate when any of the linked characters are loaded.

## Feature Overview

### What It Does
- **Global Lorebooks**: Active whenever enabled, regardless of which character is loaded
- **Character-Linked Lorebooks**: Only active when any of the linked characters are loaded
- **Multi-Character Support**: Link a single lorebook to multiple characters (e.g., team lorebooks)
- **Combined Mode**: Global lorebooks + character-specific lorebooks work together

### Use Cases
1. **Character Backstories**: Create a lorebook for each character's unique history
2. **Character Abilities**: Define character-specific powers and skills
3. **Team/Group Lorebooks**: Share lore across multiple characters (e.g., team history, shared adventures)
4. **World + Character**: Combine global world rules with character-specific details
5. **Story Arcs**: Different lorebooks for different phases of a character's story

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

**lorebook_manager.py:**
- ✅ **Multi-Character Support**: Added `linked_characters` field (list) replacing single `linked_character` (string)
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Automatically migrates old single-character format to new list format
- Modified `create_lorebook()` to accept `linked_characters` parameter (list of character names)
- Updated `get_system_prompt_section()` to filter by checking if character is in list
- Enhanced `update_lorebook_metadata()` to handle character lists
- Import/export preserves both old and new formats for compatibility

**discord_bot.py:**
- Passes current character name to lorebook system when building prompts
- Character-specific lorebooks automatically activate/deactivate with character changes

**web_server.py:**
- API endpoints updated to handle `linked_characters` field (list)
- Creation and update endpoints support both single character and multiple characters
- Maintains backward compatibility with old `linked_character` field

### Frontend Changes

**templates/index.html:**
- **Multi-Character Selection Interface**: Dropdown + "+ Add" button for adding characters
- **Character Management**: "−" buttons next to each linked character for easy removal
- **Visual Display**: Shows all linked characters (e.g., "Linked to: Luna, Sherlock, Alice")
- Character selector in "Create New Lorebook" dialog
- "Edit Metadata" button and dialog for existing lorebooks
- Character dropdown auto-populated with available characters
- Display of linked characters in lorebook info ([Global] or [Linked to: Name1, Name2, ...])
- Lorebook list shows all character links for each lorebook

### How It Works

**Filtering Logic (Updated for Multi-Character):**
```python
for each lorebook:
    if lorebook is disabled:
        skip
    
    if lorebook.linked_characters is None or empty:
        include (global lorebook)
    elif current_character in lorebook.linked_characters:
        include (current character is in the list)
    else:
        skip (current character not in list)
```

**Example:**
```
Lorebooks:
- "Fantasy World" (Global)
- "Team Adventure" (Linked to: Luna, Sherlock, Alice)
- "Luna's Powers" (Linked to: Luna)
- "Sherlock's Methods" (Linked to: Sherlock)

When Luna is active:
✓ Fantasy World (global)
✓ Team Adventure (Luna is in the list)
✓ Luna's Powers (linked to Luna)
✗ Sherlock's Methods (Luna not in list)

When Sherlock is active:
✓ Fantasy World (global)
✓ Team Adventure (Sherlock is in the list)
✗ Luna's Powers (Sherlock not in list)
✓ Sherlock's Methods (linked to Sherlock)

When Bob is active:
✓ Fantasy World (global)
✗ Team Adventure (Bob not in list)
✗ Luna's Powers (Bob not in list)
✗ Sherlock's Methods (Bob not in list)

When no character is active:
✓ Fantasy World (global)
✗ Team Adventure (needs a linked character)
✗ Luna's Powers (needs Luna)
✗ Sherlock's Methods (needs Sherlock)
```

## Testing

### Automated Tests (test_character_linked_lorebook.py)
All backward compatibility tests pass ✅ (14 tests):
1. Create global lorebook
2. Create character-linked lorebook
3. System prompt without character (only global)
4. System prompt with character (global + character-specific)
5. Update linked character
6. Import/export with linked character
7. Disabled character lorebooks

### Automated Tests (test_multi_character_lorebook.py)
All multi-character tests pass ✅ (12 tests):
1. Create multi-character lorebook
2. System prompt with multiple characters (filtering)
3. Update lorebook to multiple characters
4. Import/export with multiple characters
5. Backward compatibility - single to multi migration
6. Empty list treated as global

### UI Tests (test_ui_changes.py)
All UI tests pass ✅:
- HTML contains multi-character UI elements
- Display logic supports multiple characters
- +/- button functionality present

### Manual Testing
✅ UI properly displays multiple character links
✅ Create dialog shows character selector with "+ Add" button
✅ Edit dialog allows adding/removing characters
✅ Lorebook list shows all linked characters
✅ Character filtering works correctly with multiple characters
✅ Backward compatibility maintained
✅ Migration from single to multiple characters works automatically

## Backward Compatibility

- ✅ **Automatic Migration**: Old `linked_character` (string) automatically converted to `linked_characters` (list)
- ✅ **API Support**: Endpoints support both old and new formats
- ✅ **Export Format**: Exports include both formats for maximum compatibility
- ✅ **Existing Lorebooks**: Default to global (linked_characters = null)
- ✅ **No Breaking Changes**: All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ **Transparent Migration**: Users don't need to do anything

## Documentation

Updated CHARACTER_LINKED_LOREBOOK_COMPLETE.md with:
- Multi-character support explanation
- Updated filtering logic and examples
- Team/group lorebook use cases
- Instructions for linking multiple characters
- Updated JSON format examples showing lists

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Character-specific lore is separate from world lore
2. **Token Efficiency**: Only relevant lore is loaded with each character
3. **Flexibility**: Mix global and character-specific lorebooks
4. **Team Lorebooks**: Share lore across multiple characters ✨ NEW
5. **Easy Management**: +/− buttons for adding/removing characters ✨ NEW
6. **Shareable**: Export character lorebooks with character cards
7. **No Conflicts**: Different characters can have different lore without interference
8. **Automatic Activation**: Lorebooks activate/deactivate with character changes

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential improvements that could be added:
- ~~Character groups (link lorebook to multiple characters)~~ ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Lorebook templates for common character types
- Auto-suggest lorebook names based on character
- Bulk character linking operations
- Character lorebook preview in character selection

## Conclusion

The character-linked lorebook feature is fully implemented, tested, and documented, **now with multi-character support**. It provides users with the exact functionality requested in the issue: the ability to link lorebooks to multiple characters, not just one. Users can now easily manage shared lorebooks for teams or groups while maintaining character-specific and global lorebooks. The implementation is backward compatible and follows the existing patterns in the codebase.

**Status**: ✅ Complete and Ready for Use
