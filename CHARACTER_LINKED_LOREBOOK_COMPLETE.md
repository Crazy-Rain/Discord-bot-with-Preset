# Character-Linked Lorebook Feature - Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented the ability to link lorebooks to specific AI characters. This feature allows users to organize lore more effectively and have character-specific information automatically activate when that character is loaded.

## Feature Overview

### What It Does
- **Global Lorebooks**: Active whenever enabled, regardless of which character is loaded
- **Character-Linked Lorebooks**: Only active when the linked character is loaded
- **Combined Mode**: Global lorebooks + character-specific lorebooks work together

### Use Cases
1. **Character Backstories**: Create a lorebook for each character's unique history
2. **Character Abilities**: Define character-specific powers and skills
3. **World + Character**: Combine global world rules with character-specific details
4. **Story Arcs**: Different lorebooks for different phases of a character's story

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

**lorebook_manager.py:**
- Added `linked_character` field to lorebook structure
- Modified `create_lorebook()` to accept `linked_character` parameter
- Updated `get_system_prompt_section()` to filter by character
- Enhanced `update_lorebook_metadata()` to handle character linking
- Import/export preserves `linked_character` field

**discord_bot.py:**
- Passes current character name to lorebook system when building prompts
- Character-specific lorebooks automatically activate/deactivate with character changes

**web_server.py:**
- API endpoints updated to handle `linked_character` field
- Creation and update endpoints support character linking

### Frontend Changes

**templates/index.html:**
- Character selector in "Create New Lorebook" dialog
- "Edit Metadata" button and dialog for existing lorebooks
- Character dropdown auto-populated with available characters
- Display of linked character in lorebook info ([Global] or [Linked to: Name])
- Lorebook list shows character links for each lorebook

### How It Works

**Filtering Logic:**
```python
for each lorebook:
    if lorebook is disabled:
        skip
    
    if lorebook.linked_character is None:
        include (global lorebook)
    elif lorebook.linked_character == current_character:
        include (matches current character)
    else:
        skip (different character)
```

**Example:**
```
Lorebooks:
- "Fantasy World" (Global)
- "Luna's Powers" (Linked to: Luna)
- "Sherlock's Methods" (Linked to: Sherlock)

When Luna is active:
✓ Fantasy World (global)
✓ Luna's Powers (linked to Luna)
✗ Sherlock's Methods (linked to different character)

When Sherlock is active:
✓ Fantasy World (global)
✗ Luna's Powers (linked to different character)
✓ Sherlock's Methods (linked to Sherlock)

When no character is active:
✓ Fantasy World (global)
✗ Luna's Powers (needs Luna)
✗ Sherlock's Methods (needs Sherlock)
```

## Testing

### Automated Tests (test_character_linked_lorebook.py)
All tests pass ✅:
1. Create global lorebook
2. Create character-linked lorebook
3. System prompt without character (only global)
4. System prompt with character (global + character-specific)
5. Update linked character
6. Import/export with linked character
7. Disabled character lorebooks

### Manual Testing
✅ UI properly displays character links
✅ Create dialog shows character dropdown
✅ Edit dialog allows changing character link
✅ Lorebook list shows linked character
✅ Character filtering works correctly
✅ Backward compatibility maintained

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing lorebooks default to global (linked_character = null)
- Legacy lorebook format still supported
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Migration automatic and transparent

## Documentation

Updated LOREBOOK_GUIDE.md with:
- Explanation of character-linked vs global lorebooks
- Instructions for creating character-linked lorebooks
- How to edit lorebook metadata
- Practical usage scenarios and examples
- Best practices for organization
- Updated JSON format examples

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Character-specific lore is separate from world lore
2. **Token Efficiency**: Only relevant lore is loaded with each character
3. **Flexibility**: Mix global and character-specific lorebooks
4. **Automatic Activation**: Lorebooks activate/deactivate with character changes
5. **Shareable**: Export character lorebooks with character cards
6. **No Conflicts**: Different characters can have different lore without interference

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Character groups (link lorebook to multiple characters)
- Lorebook templates for common character types
- Auto-suggest lorebook names based on character
- Bulk character linking operations
- Character lorebook preview in character selection

## Conclusion

The character-linked lorebook feature is fully implemented, tested, and documented. It provides users with the exact functionality requested in the issue: the ability to link lorebooks to specific characters while maintaining global lorebooks for world rules. The implementation is backward compatible and follows the existing patterns in the codebase.

**Status**: ✅ Complete and Ready for Use
