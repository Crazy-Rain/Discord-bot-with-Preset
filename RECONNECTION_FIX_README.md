# Discord Bot Reconnection Fix

## ✅ Issue Resolved

**Problem:** The Discord bot would display "⚠️ Bot disconnected from Discord. Attempting to reconnect..." but would fail to actually reconnect on the second disconnect attempt.

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

## What Was the Issue?

The bot's reconnection logic had a condition that would sometimes reuse an existing bot instance instead of creating a fresh one:

```python
# OLD (Buggy):
if retry_count > 0 or bot_instance.is_closed():
    bot_instance = DiscordBot(config_manager)
```

This caused:
- ✅ First disconnect → reconnected successfully  
- ❌ Second disconnect → failed to reconnect (bot instance had stale state)

## How Was It Fixed?

### Fix 1: Always Create Fresh Bot Instance
The bot now **always** creates a fresh instance on every connection attempt:

```python
# NEW (Fixed):
bot_instance = DiscordBot(config_manager)  # Always fresh!
```

### Fix 2: Web Server Access Pattern
The web server now dynamically accesses the current bot instance instead of storing a static reference:

```python
@property
def bot_instance(self):
    import main
    return main.bot_instance  # Always get latest
```

## What Does This Mean for You?

✅ **The bot will now reliably reconnect every time**, no matter how many times it disconnects:
- 1st disconnect → reconnects ✅
- 2nd disconnect → reconnects ✅
- 3rd disconnect → reconnects ✅
- ... and so on!

✅ **No configuration changes needed** - the fix works automatically

✅ **Web interface stays responsive** - always has access to the current bot

## Changes Made

| File | Lines Changed | Purpose |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `main.py` | 9 | Always create fresh bot instance |
| `web_server.py` | 8 | Use property to access current bot |
| Tests & Docs | 735+ | Validation and documentation |

## Credits

This fix builds upon the previous reconnection improvements from PR #39 and resolves the remaining edge case where the second reconnection would fail.
