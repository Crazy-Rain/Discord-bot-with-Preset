## 🎯 Requirements Met

From the original problem statement:
> "I want to try and Improve the Swipe functionality. What I want to do, is when you use 'Swipe', 'Left Swipe', 'Right Swipe', is to Edit the Message that you are clicking the Button on, rather then posting a New one!"

✅ **COMPLETE** - All swipe buttons now edit the message instead of posting new ones.

> "Probably a good idea to Retain the Messages, so we can swipe between them?"

✅ **COMPLETE** - Messages are retained in the `response_alternatives` data structure, allowing navigation between them.

> "Maybe add a 'Done' button, for finishing the Swipes, so it can clear that information, so it's not storing extra information that it doesn't need."

✅ **COMPLETE** - Added Done button (✅) that removes the buttons from the message.

## 🔍 Technical Highlights

### Message Editing
- **Regular Messages**: Uses `message.edit(embed=embed, view=view)`
- **Webhook Messages**: Uses `webhook.edit_message(message_id, embed=embed, view=view)`
- **Long Messages**: Gracefully handles messages >4096 chars with first-page display

### Button Behavior
- **Swipe Left** (◀): Edits to show previous alternative
- **Swipe** (🔄): Generates new alternative and edits to show it
- **Swipe Right** (▶): Edits to show next alternative
- **Delete** (🗑️): Removes the message entirely
- **Done** (✅): Removes buttons but keeps the message

### Data Flow
1. User clicks swipe button
2. Bot retrieves alternative from `response_alternatives`
3. Bot calls `edit_long_message()` or `edit_as_character()`
4. Message is updated in-place
5. Ephemeral notification shows alternative count

## 🎨 UX Improvements

### Before (Old Behavior)
- Clicking swipe posted a new message
- Channel became cluttered with duplicates
- Hard to track which message was being swiped
- No way to clean up except manual deletion

### After (New Behavior)
- Clicking swipe edits the existing message
- Channel stays clean (only one message)
- Clear which message is being swiped
- Done button provides easy cleanup
