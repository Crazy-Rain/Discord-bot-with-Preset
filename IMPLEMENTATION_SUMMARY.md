## How It Works

```
User saves character description:
  !update Alice: A brave warrior with red hair...
                    ↓
  UserCharactersManager saves to user_characters.json
                    ↓
User chats as Alice:
  !chat Alice: "Hello!"
                    ↓
  Bot checks if Alice has a description
                    ↓
  System prompt is enhanced with:
    [Alice Description]
    Name: Alice
    Description: A brave warrior with red hair...
    Note: This is a User Character...
    [/Alice Description]
                    ↓
  AI responds with context about Alice
```

## System Prompt Format

When a user character is used in chat, their description is added to the system prompt:

```
[<Character Name> Description]
Name: <Character Name>
Description: <Description of Character>
Note: This is a User Character, for referencing when <Character Name> is doing something, 
In scene, or needing to be referenced in some manner. Do not Act, or Write for this 
Character, they are only for the Human to Act/Write/Play as.
[/<Character Name> Description]
```

This format ensures:
- AI knows the character's appearance and traits
- AI understands it should NOT act as this character
- AI can reference the character appropriately in responses

## Data Storage

All user character descriptions are stored in:
```
user_characters/user_characters.json
```

Format:
```json
{
  "Alice": {
    "name": "Alice",
    "description": "A brave warrior with long red hair and green eyes..."
  },
  "Bob": {
    "name": "Bob",
    "description": "A skilled archer with short brown hair..."
  }
}
```
