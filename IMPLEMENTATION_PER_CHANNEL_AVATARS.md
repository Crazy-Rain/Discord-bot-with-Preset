# Per-Channel Character Avatars - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a webhook-based system for displaying different character avatars per Discord channel, bypassing Discord's 2-per-hour rate limit on bot avatar changes.

## Problem Statement

The original request asked:
> "Can we build an Image that can Dynamically update, according to the character, without it being restricted by Discord's Icon change Cooldown? Making it so it only changes on the Server that the character was loaded on (So, we'd need to separate the Servers, for which character is currently loaded there?), or if we can, going even Further, to make it a Per Channel type of change, so that you could have the Bot handling different characters on different Channels?"

## Solution

Discord bots **cannot** have different profile pictures per server or channel - this is a Discord API limitation. However, we implemented a **webhook-based solution** that achieves the desired functionality:

### How It Works

1. **Webhooks Instead of Bot Avatar**: When a character is loaded in a channel, the bot uses Discord webhooks to send messages with the character's custom name and avatar
2. **Per-Channel Tracking**: Each channel independently tracks which character is loaded
3. **Unlimited Switches**: No rate limits - switch characters as often as desired
4. **Multi-Character Support**: Different characters can be active in different channels simultaneously

### Technical Implementation

#### New Data Structures

```python
# Track loaded character per channel
self.channel_characters: Dict[int, Dict[str, any]] = {}

# Cache webhooks to avoid recreating them
self.channel_webhooks: Dict[int, discord.Webhook] = {}
```

#### Key Methods Added

1. **`get_or_create_webhook(channel)`**
   - Retrieves existing webhook or creates new one
   - Caches webhooks for reuse
   - Handles permission errors gracefully

2. **`send_as_character(channel, content, character_data)`**
   - Sends messages via webhook with character's name and avatar
   - Splits long messages automatically
   - Returns success/failure status

#### Modified Commands

1. **`!character <name>` Command**
   - **Old behavior**: Changed bot's global avatar (rate limited)
   - **New behavior**: Loads character for current channel only (no rate limits)
   - Stores character data in `channel_characters[channel_id]`
   - No longer modifies global bot avatar

2. **`!chat <message>` Command**
   - Checks if character is loaded for channel
   - If yes: sends response via webhook with character's avatar
   - If no: sends normal bot message
   - Fallback to normal message if webhook fails

3. **`!swipe`, `!swipe_left`, `!swipe_right` Commands**
   - Updated to use webhooks when character is loaded
   - Maintains consistent character appearance for alternatives

4. **`!clear` Command**
   - Now also clears channel character data

#### New Commands

1. **`!current_character`**
   - Shows which character is loaded in current channel
   - Displays character name and avatar URL

2. **`!unload_character`**
   - Removes character from current channel
   - Bot returns to normal message behavior

## File Changes

## Benefits Over Global Avatar

| Aspect | Global Avatar (Old) | Per-Channel Webhooks (New) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Rate Limit | 2 changes/hour | Unlimited |
| Scope | All servers & channels | Per channel |
| Multi-Character | No | Yes |
| Name Display | Bot nickname | Character name |
| Avatar Display | Bot global avatar | Character's avatar URL |
| Switching Speed | Slow (30min wait) | Instant |

## Requirements

### Discord Permissions

The bot needs **"Manage Webhooks"** permission to use this feature:
- Without it: Falls back to normal messages (no avatars)
- With it: Full webhook functionality enabled

### Character Card Setup

Characters need an `avatar_url` field:
```json
{
  "name": "Luna",
  "personality": "...",
  "description": "...",
  "avatar_url": "https://example.com/luna-avatar.png"
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```
User: !character luna
Bot: ✨ Loaded character Luna for this channel!

User: !chat Hello!
Luna: Hi there! How can I help you today?
[Message appears with Luna's avatar and name]
```

### Multi-Channel Usage

**Channel #roleplay-1:**
```
User: !character luna
User: !chat Tell me a story
Luna: Once upon a time...
```

**Channel #roleplay-2 (simultaneously):**
```
User: !character sherlock
User: !chat Solve this mystery
Sherlock Holmes: Elementary, my dear Watson...
```

Both channels maintain independent character states!

### Character Management

```
User: !current_character
Bot: Current character: Luna
     Avatar URL: https://example.com/luna.png

User: !unload_character
Bot: ✨ Unloaded character Luna from this channel

User: !character sherlock
Bot: ✨ Loaded character Sherlock Holmes for this channel!
```

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Permission Errors**: Falls back to normal messages
2. **Webhook Failures**: Catches exceptions and uses fallback
3. **Invalid Avatar URLs**: Webhook works with character name only
4. **Deleted Webhooks**: Automatically recreates them
5. **Missing Characters**: Clear error messages

## Testing Results

All structural tests pass:
- ✅ Syntax validation: Valid Python
- ✅ Character manager: Works correctly
- ✅ Bot structure: All new code present
- ✅ Webhook logic: All patterns implemented
- ✅ Documentation: Complete and comprehensive

## Backwards Compatibility

- ✅ Existing commands still work
- ✅ Old global avatar methods preserved (not called)
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Graceful fallback when webhooks unavailable

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Per-server default characters
2. Auto-load character based on channel name
3. Character presets per channel
4. Webhook message editing support
5. Avatar caching for faster loading

## Conclusion

This implementation successfully addresses the original problem:

✅ **Dynamic Updates**: Characters can be changed instantly without cooldown
✅ **Per-Channel**: Each channel can have a different character
✅ **No Rate Limits**: Unlimited character switches
✅ **Multi-Character**: Different characters in different channels simultaneously
✅ **Backwards Compatible**: No breaking changes

The webhook-based approach provides a superior solution to the global avatar method, eliminating rate limits while enabling true per-channel character separation.
