## 🎯 What You Need to Do RIGHT NOW

### Step 1: Read This First 👇
**📖 [WHAT_TO_DO_NEXT.md](WHAT_TO_DO_NEXT.md)** - Your complete action plan

### Step 2: Run the Verification Script
```bash
python verify_guild_detection.py
```
This will tell you exactly what's wrong (if anything).

### Step 3: Start the Bot Correctly
```bash
python main.py    # ✅ Use this
# NOT: uv run main.py  # ❌ Causes issues
```

### Step 4: Watch the Console Output
Look for this:
```
✅ Bot is in X server(s):
   - Your Server (ID: ..., X channels)
```

**OR this (if bot not in any servers):**
```
⚠️ WARNING: Bot is connected but not in any servers!

```

### Step 5: Open Web Interface
```
http://localhost:5000
```
Check the Manual Send tab - servers should appear!

If they don't appear immediately, the page will **auto-retry 3 times** (every 3 seconds). Just wait a moment.

## 🎬 Most Likely Scenario & Solution

Based on your problem description, here's what **probably** happened:

### The Issue
1. ✅ Bot connects to Discord successfully
2. ✅ Shows as "Online and Active"
3. ❌ But bot is **not added to any Discord servers**
4. ❌ So `bot.guilds` is empty
5. ❌ Web interface shows "NO SERVERS"

### The Fix
1. **Add bot to a Discord server using OAuth2:**
   - Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
   - Select your bot → OAuth2 → URL Generator
   - Check "bot" scope + permissions
   - Copy URL → Open in browser → Add to server

2. **Restart the bot:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Verify in console:**
   ```
   ✅ Bot is in 1 server(s):
      - My Server (ID: 123456789, 5 text channels)
   ```

4. **Open web interface:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

5. **✅ Servers appear in Manual Send dropdown!**
