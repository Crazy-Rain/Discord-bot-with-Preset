# Multi-Embed Message Response Fix - Summary

## Issue

The `!swipe_right` command was not properly tracking message IDs for multi-page (multi-embed) responses when using webhook messages (character mode). This caused the following problems:

1. When using the `!swipe_right` command with a character loaded, the `view.message_ids` was not being updated
2. The fallback case (when webhook fails) was using the old `send_long_message()` function which doesn't return message IDs
3. The code was checking `if not webhook_sent:` where `webhook_sent` was actually a tuple `(last_msg, msg_ids)`, not a boolean

This meant that when swiping through multi-page responses:
- The button handlers couldn't track all the message IDs
- Future swipes wouldn't be able to delete/replace all pages of the response
- Only the first page would be updated during swipes

## Root Cause

In the `!swipe_right` command (around line 1734), the code was:

```python
webhook_sent = await self.send_as_character(
    ctx.channel, 
    response, 
    character_data,
    view=view
)
if not webhook_sent:
    # Fallback to normal message if webhook fails - use embeds
    await send_long_message(ctx, response, view=view)
```

**Problems:**
1. `send_as_character()` returns a tuple `(last_msg, msg_ids)`, not a boolean
2. The check `if not webhook_sent:` was wrong - a tuple `(None, [])` is truthy!
3. Even if the check worked, the fallback used `send_long_message()` which doesn't return message IDs
4. The `view.message_ids` was never updated when webhooks succeeded

## Solution

Changed the code to properly unpack the tuple and update message IDs:

```python
last_msg, msg_ids = await self.send_as_character(
    ctx.channel, 
    response, 
    character_data,
    view=view
)
if not last_msg:
    # Fallback to normal message if webhook fails - use embeds
    last_msg, msg_ids = await send_long_message_with_view(ctx.channel, response, view=view)
# Update view with message IDs for multi-page swipe support
if msg_ids:
    view.message_ids = msg_ids
```

**Fixes:**
1. ✅ Properly unpacks the tuple returned by `send_as_character()`
2. ✅ Checks `if not last_msg:` instead of checking the tuple
3. ✅ Uses `send_long_message_with_view()` in fallback, which returns `(last_msg, msg_ids)`
4. ✅ Always updates `view.message_ids` regardless of whether webhook or fallback was used

## Files Modified

- **discord_bot.py** - Fixed the `!swipe_right` command (lines 1727-1752)

## Impact

This fix ensures that:
1. Multi-page responses are properly tracked when using the `!swipe_right` command
2. The swipe button handlers can properly delete and replace ALL pages when swiping
3. Characters with webhooks work the same as regular messages for multi-page responses
4. The fallback mechanism works correctly when webhooks fail

## Testing

Created and ran tests to verify:
1. ✅ The correct code pattern is now in place
2. ✅ No syntax errors in the modified code
3. ✅ Existing embed splitting tests still pass
4. ✅ The function signatures and return values are correct

## Notes

The `!swipe_left` and `!swipe` commands were already correctly implemented and did not require changes. The button-based swipe handlers (in SwipeButtonView class) were also already correct, using the `replace_as_character()` and `replace_multi_page_message()` functions which properly handle multi-page responses.

This was a targeted fix for a specific bug in the `!swipe_right` command that prevented multi-embed messages from working properly with that command.
