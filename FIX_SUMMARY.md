# Fix Summary: Server/Channel Display Issue

## Problem
The Servers/Channels tab showed "No servers connected" even though the bot was connected to Discord.

## Root Cause
```
main.py had duplicate bot creation:
1. Line 89: bot_instance = DiscordBot()    # First bot
2. Line 29: bot_instance = DiscordBot()    # Second bot (in run_discord_bot)

The web server got a reference to the FIRST bot (which never connected)
The SECOND bot connected to Discord (but web server didn't know about it)
```

## Fix Applied
**Removed the duplicate bot creation on line 29**

```diff
  async def run_discord_bot(config_manager: ConfigManager):
      global bot_instance, shutdown_flag
-     bot_instance = DiscordBot(config_manager)  # ← Removed this line
      token = config_manager.get("discord_token")
```

## Result
- ✅ Web server now sees the same bot instance that connects to Discord
- ✅ Servers/Channels tab displays all connected servers correctly
- ✅ Channels within each server are accessible
- ✅ Channel configuration works as expected

## What Changed
**Files Modified:**
- `main.py` - Removed 1 line (the duplicate bot creation)
- `SERVER_CHANNEL_FIX.md` - Added documentation

**Total Changes:** -1 line of code + documentation

## Testing
All tests pass:
- ✅ Unit tests for bot instance reference
- ✅ Integration tests for complete flow
- ✅ Server/channel API endpoint tests
- ✅ End-to-end user experience test
- ✅ Existing test suite (test_server_channels_fix.py)
- ✅ Web interface tests (test_web_interface_fix.py)

## How to Verify
1. Run the bot: `python main.py`
2. Wait for "Bot is ready!" message
3. Open http://localhost:5000
4. Click "Servers/Channels" tab
5. ✅ You should see all your Discord servers and channels

## Before & After
**Before Fix:**
- Console: "Bot is ready! Logged in as..."
- Console: "Loading X channel configurations..."
- Web UI: "No servers connected. Make sure the bot is running..."
- Result: ❌ Confusing - bot is connected but UI says it's not

**After Fix:**
- Console: "Bot is ready! Logged in as..."
- Console: "Loading X channel configurations..."
- Web UI: Shows list of servers with channel counts
- Result: ✅ Everything works as expected
