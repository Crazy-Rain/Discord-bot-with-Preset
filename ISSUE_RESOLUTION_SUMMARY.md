# Issue Resolution Summary

## Issues Addressed

### Issue 1: Bot Configuration Page Not Working Correctly ✅ FIXED
**Symptom**: When selecting/loading a Proxy or Endpoint URL and saving in the Bot Configuration page, Discord messages were still being sent to the first URL without updating.

**Root Cause**: The `config_manager.py` module had a critical bug where `update_config()` used Python's shallow `dict.update()` method. This replaced entire nested dictionaries instead of merging them. When the API key was hidden in the web interface (displayed as `***HIDDEN***`), it was removed from the update data. The shallow update then replaced the entire `openai_config` dictionary, causing the API key to be permanently deleted.

**Fix**: Implemented a `deep_update()` method that recursively merges nested dictionaries, preserving fields that aren't being updated.

**Impact**: Users can now safely update proxy URLs and models without losing their API keys. Configuration changes apply immediately to the running bot.

### Issue 2: Lorebook Information Not Being Used by AI ✅ INVESTIGATED & ENHANCED
**Symptom**: Despite having lorebooks active and linked to characters, the AI didn't appear to be using the information, even for entries set to 'Constant'.

**Findings**: After comprehensive testing, **the lorebook system is working correctly**. All core functionality tests pass. The issue was not a bug but likely user configuration or expectations mismatch.

**Enhancements Made**:
1. **Debug Logging**: Added comprehensive console logging that shows exactly what lorebooks are being used and why
2. **Documentation**: Created troubleshooting guide with common issues and solutions
3. **Test Coverage**: Added tests for all lorebook scenarios

**Common User Issues** (not bugs):
- Lorebook not marked as "Enabled"
- Character name mismatch (case-sensitive: "Luna" ≠ "luna")
- Entry activation type not set to "Constant"
- Character not loaded for the channel
- No entries actually created in the lorebook

## Verification

### Config Update Fix
```python
# Before: Updating base_url would delete api_key
config = {'openai_config': {'api_key': 'secret', 'base_url': 'url1'}}
update = {'openai_config': {'base_url': 'url2'}}  # No api_key
config.update(update)  # Result: {'openai_config': {'base_url': 'url2'}}  ❌

# After: Deep update preserves api_key
deep_update(config, update)  # Result: {'openai_config': {'api_key': 'secret', 'base_url': 'url2'}}  ✅
```

### Lorebook Debug Output
```
[LOREBOOK] Getting lorebook entries for character: Luna
[LOREBOOK] Total lorebooks: 2
[LOREBOOK] Including lorebook 'Global Lore' (linked_chars: None)
[LOREBOOK]   Added constant entry: Magic System
[LOREBOOK] Including lorebook 'Luna Lore' (linked_chars: ['Luna'])
[LOREBOOK]   Added constant entry: Luna's Past
[LOREBOOK] Total entries to include: 2
[LOREBOOK] Added lorebook section (290 chars)
```

## For Users

### Config Updates
1. Load a saved API configuration or edit fields
2. Click "Save Configuration"
3. Changes apply immediately - no restart needed
4. API keys are preserved when other fields are updated

### Lorebook Troubleshooting
If lorebooks aren't working, check the bot console for `[LOREBOOK]` messages. They will tell you exactly:
- Which lorebooks are being checked
- Which entries are being included
- Why lorebooks are being skipped

Common fixes:
- ✅ Enable the lorebook (checkbox in Lorebook tab)
- ✅ Match character names exactly (case-sensitive)
- ✅ Set entries to "Constant" activation type
- ✅ Load the character for the channel (`!character name`)
- ✅ Verify entries exist in the lorebook

See `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed help.

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible. No migration needed.
- Existing configs will continue to work
- Old lorebooks will continue to work
- Debug logging is non-breaking

---

## Summary

✅ **Issue 1**: FIXED - Config updates now work correctly, preserving all fields
✅ **Issue 2**: WORKING - Lorebook system verified to work correctly with debug logging added for diagnostics

Users experiencing issues should check the console logs and troubleshooting guide to identify configuration problems.
