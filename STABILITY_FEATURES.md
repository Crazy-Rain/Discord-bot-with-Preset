# 🛡️ Bot Stability Improvements

> **Recent Update:** The bot now includes automatic reconnection, error handling, and graceful shutdown features!

## What's New

The Discord bot has been enhanced with robust stability features to handle connection issues, errors, and shutdowns gracefully.

### ✨ Key Features

#### 🔄 Automatic Reconnection
- **Exponential backoff retry** (5 attempts max)
- **Smart delay strategy**: 5s → 10s → 20s → 30s → 30s
- **Self-healing** from temporary connection issues
- **No manual intervention needed**

#### 📊 Event Monitoring
- **on_disconnect()** - Logs disconnection events
- **on_resume()** - Logs successful reconnection
- **on_error()** - Captures and logs errors with full traceback

#### 🛑 Graceful Shutdown
- **Clean Ctrl+C handling** (SIGINT)
- **Termination signal support** (SIGTERM)
- **Proper resource cleanup**
- **No shutdown errors**

### 📋 Quick Start

```bash
# Run the bot normally - improvements are automatic
python main.py

# Test the stability features
python test_bot_stability.py

# See an interactive demo
python demo_stability_improvements.py
```
