# Multi-Character Lorebook Linking - Implementation Summary

## Problem Statement
The user wanted to link lorebooks to multiple characters, not just one:
> "I want to be able to use some of those Lorebooks on multiple characters, just not Everyone. So it only seems fitting that we should have some kind of 'Selection' where you can select multiple Characters to link that Lorebook to."

## Solution Implemented

### Before
- ❌ Could only link a lorebook to ONE character
- ❌ Had to create duplicate lorebooks for shared content
- ❌ Single dropdown for character selection
- Data model: `linked_character: "Luna"` (string)

### After
- ✅ Can link a lorebook to MULTIPLE characters
- ✅ Team/group lorebooks work across multiple characters
- ✅ Multi-select UI with +/− buttons
- Data model: `linked_characters: ["Luna", "Sherlock", "Alice"]` (list)

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Character Selection UI
- Dropdown to select characters
- "+ Add" button to add to list
- "−" button next to each character to remove
- Visual display of all linked characters

### 2. Smart Filtering
- Global lorebook (no characters) → Active for everyone
- Single character lorebook → Active for that character
- Multi-character lorebook → Active for ANY of the linked characters

### 3. Backward Compatibility
- Old format automatically migrated: `"linked_character": "Luna"` → `"linked_characters": ["Luna"]`
- Export includes both formats for compatibility
- Existing lorebooks work without changes
- API supports both old and new formats

## Example Use Cases

### Team Lorebook
```json
{
  "name": "Adventure Team Lore",
  "linked_characters": ["Luna", "Sherlock", "Alice"],
  "entries": {
    "Team History": "The team formed three years ago...",
    "Team Base": "They operate from an abandoned lighthouse..."
  }
}
```
**Result**: Active when Luna, Sherlock, OR Alice is loaded

### Character-Specific + Team
```
Lorebooks:
1. "Fantasy World" - Global (no links)
2. "Adventure Team" - Linked to: [Luna, Sherlock, Alice]
3. "Luna's Secrets" - Linked to: [Luna]
4. "Sherlock's Methods" - Linked to: [Sherlock]

When Luna is active:
  ✅ Fantasy World (global)
  ✅ Adventure Team (Luna in list)
  ✅ Luna's Secrets (Luna in list)
  ❌ Sherlock's Methods (Luna not in list)

When Sherlock is active:
  ✅ Fantasy World (global)
  ✅ Adventure Team (Sherlock in list)
  ❌ Luna's Secrets (Sherlock not in list)
  ✅ Sherlock's Methods (Sherlock in list)

When Bob is active:
  ✅ Fantasy World (global)
  ❌ Adventure Team (Bob not in list)
  ❌ Luna's Secrets (Bob not in list)
  ❌ Sherlock's Methods (Bob not in list)
```

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (lorebook_manager.py)
- Changed data model from string to list
- Updated filtering logic: `if character_name in lorebook.linked_characters`
- Added migration function for old format
- Maintained backward compatibility in all methods

### API (web_server.py)
- Accept both `linked_character` (old) and `linked_characters` (new)
- Return both fields for compatibility
- Create/update endpoints handle lists

### Frontend (templates/index.html)
- New multi-select interface
- JavaScript arrays to track selected characters
- Functions: `addCharacterToLorebook()`, `removeCharacterFromLorebook()`
- Display: "Linked to: Luna, Sherlock, Alice"

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- ✅ 14 backward compatibility tests (all pass)
- ✅ 12 new multi-character tests (all pass)
- ✅ 2 UI validation tests (all pass)
- ✅ **Total: 28 tests passing**

### Test Scenarios
1. Create multi-character lorebook
2. System prompt filtering with multiple characters
3. Update from single to multiple characters
4. Import/export with multiple characters
5. Migration from old to new format
6. Empty list treated as global
7. UI contains all required elements

## Files Modified

### Core Files
1. `lorebook_manager.py` - Data model and filtering logic
2. `web_server.py` - API endpoints
3. `templates/index.html` - User interface

### Documentation
4. `CHARACTER_LINKED_LOREBOOK_COMPLETE.md` - Updated with multi-character info
5. `LOREBOOK_GUIDE.md` - Added examples and instructions

### Testing
6. `test_multi_character_lorebook.py` - New test suite
7. `test_ui_changes.py` - UI validation
8. `multi_character_ui_demo.html` - Visual demo

## Migration Path

### For Existing Users
1. **No action required** - Migration is automatic
2. Old lorebooks with `linked_character: "Luna"` → `linked_characters: ["Luna"]`
3. UI automatically displays correctly
4. Can immediately add more characters to existing lorebooks

### For New Users
- Use the new multi-select UI from the start
- Create team lorebooks by adding multiple characters
- Intuitive +/− buttons for management

## Benefits

1. **Flexibility**: Share lorebooks across character groups
2. **Organization**: Team lorebooks, character-specific, and global all work together
3. **Efficiency**: No need for duplicate lorebooks
4. **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with existing setups
5. **User-Friendly**: Intuitive UI with +/− buttons
6. **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend (e.g., character tags, groups)

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All requirements met:
- ✅ Multiple character selection
- ✅ Easy add/remove with buttons
- ✅ Visual display of all linked characters
- ✅ Backward compatibility
- ✅ Comprehensive testing
- ✅ Documentation updated
