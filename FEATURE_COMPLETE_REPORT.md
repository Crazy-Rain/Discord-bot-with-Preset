# Feature Implementation Complete ✅

## Problem Statement Addressed

### Issue 1: Bot Name Change
**Request**: "Can the Bot Change it's Name, to match that of the Character that's currently Loaded? Not the User Characters, it's own character? If so, Let's do that."

**Solution Implemented**: ✅ COMPLETE
- Bot automatically changes its Discord nickname when a character is loaded
- Uses the character's display name from the character card
- Works with `!character <name>` command
- Applies on bot startup if character already loaded
- Works across all Discord servers the bot is in

### Issue 2: Dynamic Configuration Updates
**Request**: "Loading/Changing the Proxy it's connected to, appears to require me to restart the Bot, when updating that, or the API Key that's being used. I'd like it if we could set it up so that when this information is changed on the Config page, it's actually updating properly, so that the Bot is now using that proxy/API Key, rather then requiring a Restart."

**Solution Implemented**: ✅ COMPLETE
- API key updates apply immediately without restart
- Proxy (Base URL) updates apply immediately without restart
- Model selection updates apply immediately without restart
- Web interface provides clear feedback when live updates are applied

## How to Use

### Bot Name Change
```bash
# In Discord channel:
!character luna

# Result:
# - Bot replies: "Loaded character: luna"
# - Bot's nickname changes to "Luna" in all servers
```

### Dynamic Config Updates
```
1. Open web browser to http://localhost:5000
2. Navigate to "Configuration" tab
3. Update any of these fields:
   - API Key
   - Base URL (proxy)
   - Model
4. Click "Save Configuration"
5. See message: "Configuration updated and applied to running bot"
6. Changes are live immediately - no restart needed!
```

## Code Quality

✅ **Minimal Changes**: Only modified what was necessary
✅ **No Breaking Changes**: Backward compatible
✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for edge cases
✅ **Well Documented**: Code comments and user documentation
✅ **Tested**: Automated tests for both features
✅ **Production Ready**: Safe to deploy

## Error Handling

### Bot Name Change
- Gracefully handles permission errors (when bot lacks "Change Nickname" permission)
- Continues operation even if nickname change fails
- Handles errors per-guild independently
- No user-visible errors on permission issues

### Dynamic Config Updates
- Validates configuration before applying
- Preserves values that weren't changed
- Falls back to config file values when needed
- Clear success/error messages in web interface

## Notes

### Discord Permissions
For the bot name change to work, the bot needs the "Change Nickname" permission in your Discord server. Without this permission, the feature fails silently (no errors shown, but name won't change).

To grant permission:
1. Server Settings → Roles
2. Find bot's role
3. Enable "Change Nickname" permission

### Configuration Persistence
- All configuration changes are saved to config.json
- Changes persist across bot restarts
- Live updates apply to running instance immediately
- File updates ensure configuration is preserved

## Benefits Delivered

1. ✅ **Better Immersion**: Bot appears as the character it's roleplaying
2. ✅ **Zero Downtime**: Configuration changes without restart
3. ✅ **Developer Friendly**: Quick API switching for testing
4. ✅ **User Friendly**: Clear feedback on configuration changes
5. ✅ **Robust**: Comprehensive error handling
6. ✅ **Professional**: Well-tested and documented
