# Bot Stability Improvements

## Problem Fixed

The Discord bot was occasionally going offline and not responding to commands, while the web server continued running. When attempting to stop the bot with Ctrl+C, errors would occur during shutdown.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **No error event handlers** - The bot had no handlers for disconnection or error events
2. **No automatic reconnection** - When the bot disconnected due to network issues or Discord API problems, it would not attempt to reconnect
3. **Improper shutdown handling** - The bot did not gracefully handle Ctrl+C (SIGINT) or termination signals
4. **Poor cleanup** - The asyncio event loop and bot connection were not properly closed on shutdown

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Added Discord Event Handlers

**New event handlers in `discord_bot.py`:**

```python
async def on_disconnect(self):
    """Called when bot disconnects from Discord."""
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è  Bot disconnected from Discord. Attempting to reconnect...")

async def on_resume(self):
    """Called when bot resumes connection to Discord."""
    print("‚úÖ Bot reconnected to Discord successfully!")

async def on_error(self, event_method: str, *args, **kwargs):
    """Called when an error occurs in an event handler."""
    import traceback
    print(f"‚ùå Error in {event_method}:")
    print(traceback.format_exc())
```

These handlers provide visibility into connection issues and errors, helping you understand what's happening with the bot.

### 2. Automatic Reconnection Logic

**Implemented in `main.py`:**

- **Maximum 5 retry attempts** with exponential backoff
- **Retry delays**: 5s ‚Üí 10s ‚Üí 20s ‚Üí 30s ‚Üí 30s
- **Graceful failure** if all retries are exhausted
- **Prevents infinite loops** while still attempting reasonable recovery

```python
while not shutdown_flag and retry_count < max_retries:
    try:
        await bot_instance.start(token)
        break
    except Exception as e:
        retry_count += 1
        if retry_count < max_retries and not shutdown_flag:
            print(f"‚ùå Bot connection error: {e}")
            print(f"üîÑ Retrying in {retry_delay} seconds... (Attempt {retry_count}/{max_retries})")
            await asyncio.sleep(retry_delay)
            retry_delay = min(retry_delay * 2, 30)
```

### 3. Graceful Shutdown Handling

**Signal handlers added in `main.py`:**

```python
def signal_handler(signum, frame):
    """Handle shutdown signals gracefully."""
    global shutdown_flag
    print("\n\nüëã Shutdown signal received. Cleaning up...")
    shutdown_flag = True
    sys.exit(0)

# Register handlers
signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)   # Ctrl+C
signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal_handler)  # Kill signal
```

This ensures:
- Clean shutdown when you press Ctrl+C
- No more errors during shutdown
- Proper cleanup of resources

### 4. Proper Cleanup

**Added in `main.py`:**

```python
finally:
    # Ensure bot is properly closed
    if bot_instance and not bot_instance.is_closed():
        try:
            loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
            asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
            loop.run_until_complete(bot_instance.close())
            loop.close()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error during cleanup: {e}")
```

This ensures:
- Bot connection is always closed properly
- No lingering connections or resources
- Clean exit even if errors occur

## How to Test

A comprehensive test suite has been added: `test_bot_stability.py`

Run it with:
```bash
python test_bot_stability.py
```

Expected output:
```
‚úì PASS - Imports
‚úì PASS - Event Handlers
‚úì PASS - Signal Handlers
‚úì PASS - Reconnection Logic
‚úì PASS - Cleanup Logic
‚úì PASS - Event Handler Execution

‚úÖ All stability tests passed!
```

## Expected Behavior

### Normal Operation
- Bot starts and connects to Discord
- Web server runs in background
- Bot responds to commands normally

### When Connection Issues Occur
- Bot detects disconnection and logs: `‚ö†Ô∏è  Bot disconnected from Discord. Attempting to reconnect...`
- Bot automatically attempts to reconnect with increasing delays
- On successful reconnection: `‚úÖ Bot reconnected to Discord successfully!`
- If all retries fail, bot shuts down with clear error message

### On Shutdown (Ctrl+C)
- Signal handler catches the interrupt
- Displays: `üëã Shutdown signal received. Cleaning up...`
- Properly closes bot connection
- Clean exit with no errors

### On Errors
- Event handler errors are caught and logged with full traceback
- Bot continues running (doesn't crash completely)
- Error details help with debugging

## Benefits

1. **Improved Reliability** - Bot automatically recovers from temporary connection issues
2. **Better Visibility** - Clear logging shows what's happening with connections
3. **Clean Shutdown** - No more errors when stopping the bot
4. **Error Recovery** - Event handler errors don't crash the entire bot
5. **User-Friendly** - Informative messages help understand bot status

## Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **No breaking changes** - All existing functionality is preserved:
- All commands work as before
- Web interface unchanged
- Configuration format unchanged
- Character and preset systems unchanged

## What You Should Notice

**Before the fix:**
- Bot would occasionally stop responding
- Ctrl+C would cause errors
- No indication of what went wrong
- Manual restart required

**After the fix:**
- Bot automatically recovers from disconnections
- Ctrl+C works cleanly
- Clear status messages show what's happening
- Self-healing in most cases
