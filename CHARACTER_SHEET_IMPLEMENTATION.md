# Character Sheet Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a Character Sheet feature that allows users to add special abilities, perks, and powers to their user characters. The sheet can be enabled/disabled and is sent to the AI within `[sheet][/sheet]` tags with instructions to consider these abilities.

## Problem Statement

Users wanted to add a 'Character Sheet' to certain User Characters that would:
- Be collapsed/hidden unless enabled for them
- Track unusual abilities or 'Perks' 
- Be appended to/sent through to the AI along with the character's Description
- Be within a [sheet][/sheet] block
- Advise the AI that this is a sheet of the character's Abilities and to always take them into account

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Data Model Updates (`user_characters_manager.py`)

**Added Fields:**
- `sheet`: Text field containing the character's abilities and perks
- `sheet_enabled`: Boolean flag to enable/disable the sheet

**New Methods:**
- `update_character_sheet(name, sheet)`: Update a character's sheet content
- `set_sheet_enabled(name, enabled)`: Enable or disable a character's sheet
- Modified `add_or_update_character()`: Now accepts optional sheet parameters with None defaults to preserve existing data
- Modified `get_system_prompt_section()`: Includes sheet in [sheet][/sheet] block when enabled

**System Prompt Format:**
```
[CharacterName Description]
Name: CharacterName
Description: [character description]
[sheet]
This is a sheet of CharacterName's Abilities and Perks. Always take them into account when considering what CharacterName is able to do.
[character sheet content]
[/sheet]
Note: This is a User Character, for referencing when CharacterName is doing something...
[/CharacterName Description]
```

### 2. Discord Commands (`discord_bot.py`)

**New Commands:**
- `!set_sheet <Character Name> <Sheet Content>`: Set a character's sheet
- `!enable_sheet <Character Name>`: Enable a character's sheet
- `!disable_sheet <Character Name>`: Disable a character's sheet

**Updated Commands:**
- `!user_char <Character Name>`: Now shows sheet content and enabled/disabled status

### 3. Web Interface (`templates/index.html`)

**Added UI Elements:**
- Character Sheet textarea field
- "Enable Character Sheet" checkbox with explanatory text
- Visual "Sheet Enabled" badge in character list
- Updated JavaScript to handle sheet fields in save/load operations

**Features:**
- Sheet content preserved when editing characters
- Visual indicator showing which characters have enabled sheets
- Seamless integration with existing user character management

### 4. API Updates (`web_server.py`)

**Modified Endpoint:**
- `POST /api/user_characters/<character_name>`: Now accepts `sheet` and `sheet_enabled` fields

### 5. Testing

**Test Coverage (`test_character_sheet.py`):**
- ✅ Add character with sheet
- ✅ Update character sheet
- ✅ Enable/disable sheet
- ✅ System prompt generation with sheet enabled
- ✅ System prompt generation with sheet disabled
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing characters
- ✅ Data preservation when updating

**Demo Script (`demo_character_sheet.py`):**
- Shows practical examples with superhero and wizard characters
- Demonstrates enable/disable functionality
- Visualizes system prompt output

### 6. Documentation

**Created Files:**
- `CHARACTER_SHEET_GUIDE.md`: Comprehensive usage guide with examples
- `demo_character_sheet.py`: Interactive demonstration
- `test_character_sheet.py`: Automated test suite

## Key Features

### 1. Enable/Disable Control
- Sheets can be drafted without affecting the AI (disabled state)
- Enable when ready to use in roleplay
- Disable temporarily without losing data
- Preserves sheet content when toggling

### 2. Backward Compatibility
- Existing characters work without modification
- Missing fields default to empty/false
- Old data structure fully supported
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

### 3. AI Integration
- Sheet wrapped in `[sheet][/sheet]` tags for clear boundaries
- Explicit instruction to AI: "This is a sheet of {name}'s Abilities and Perks. Always take them into account when considering what {name} is able to do."
- Integrated seamlessly into existing system prompt flow
- Works alongside character descriptions and lorebook

### 4. Flexible Content Format
Users can format sheets however they prefer:
- List format: "Abilities: Flight, Super Strength"
- Categorized: Separate sections for abilities, perks, weaknesses
- Detailed: Full descriptions of each ability
- Any combination of the above

## Example Use Cases

### Superhero Character
```
!update Phoenix: A fiery hero with red and gold armor...
!set_sheet Phoenix Abilities: Fire Manipulation, Flight, Regeneration. Powers: Phoenix Force (resurrection). Weaknesses: Water attacks, cold environments.
!enable_sheet Phoenix
```

### Fantasy Character
```
!update Merlin: An ancient wizard with a long white beard...
!set_sheet Merlin Magic: Teleportation, Elemental Control, Illusions, Time Magic. Artifacts: Staff of Power, Amulet of Protection.
!enable_sheet Merlin
```

### Regular Character (No Sheet)
```
!update Bob: A skilled merchant with a friendly smile...
```
(No sheet needed - works normally)
