# Bot Stability Fix - Quick Reference

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**Problem:** Bot goes offline occasionally, web server still runs, Ctrl+C causes errors.

**Solution:** Added automatic reconnection, error handlers, and graceful shutdown.

## ✅ What's New

### Automatic Reconnection
- Bot reconnects automatically on disconnection
- Exponential backoff: 5s → 10s → 20s → 30s → 30s
- Max 5 retry attempts
- Clear status messages

### Event Handlers
- `on_disconnect()` - Logs when bot loses connection
- `on_resume()` - Logs when bot reconnects
- `on_error()` - Logs errors with full traceback

### Graceful Shutdown
- Ctrl+C now works cleanly
- Proper cleanup of resources
- No more shutdown errors

## 📋 Quick Commands

```bash
# Test the stability improvements
python test_bot_stability.py

# See interactive demo
python demo_stability_improvements.py

# Run the bot (normal operation)
python main.py
```

## 🔍 What You'll See
