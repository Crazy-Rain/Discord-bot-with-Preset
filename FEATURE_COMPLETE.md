# üéâ User Characters Feature - Complete Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive user character description system to the Discord bot, allowing users to save detailed character information that the AI can reference during roleplay scenarios.

## What Was Implemented

### Core Features ‚úÖ

1. **Character Storage System**
   - Save character descriptions with name and details
   - Persistent storage in `user_characters/user_characters.json`
   - Automatic loading on bot startup

2. **Discord Commands** (5 new commands)
   - `!update <Name>: <Description>` - Add/update character
   - `!user_chars` - List saved characters
   - `!user_char <name>` - View specific character
   - `!delete_user_char <name>` - Delete character
   - Updated `!help_bot` with new commands

3. **Web Interface**
   - New "User Characters" tab
   - Name and Description input fields
   - List view with Edit/Delete buttons
   - Import/Export functionality

4. **API Endpoints** (6 new endpoints)
   - `GET /api/user_characters` - List all
   - `GET /api/user_characters/<name>` - Get one
   - `POST /api/user_characters/<name>` - Save/Update
   - `DELETE /api/user_characters/<name>` - Delete
   - `GET /api/user_characters/export` - Export JSON
   - `POST /api/user_characters/import` - Import JSON

5. **System Prompt Integration**
   - Automatically adds character descriptions to AI prompts
   - Uses exact format specified in requirements
   - Only includes characters actually used in conversation

## System Prompt Format

When a user character is referenced in chat, their description is added to the system prompt:

```
[<Character Name> Description]
Name: <Character Name>
Description: <Description of Character>
Note: This is a User Character, for referencing when <Character Name> is doing something, 
In scene, or needing to be referenced in some manner. Do not Act, or Write for this 
Character, they are only for the Human to Act/Write/Play as.
[/<Character Name> Description]
```

This ensures:
- ‚úÖ AI knows character's appearance and traits
- ‚úÖ AI understands it should NOT act as this character
- ‚úÖ AI can appropriately reference the character

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Save a character
!update Alice: A brave warrior with long red hair and green eyes.

    "description": "A brave warrior..."
  }
}
```
