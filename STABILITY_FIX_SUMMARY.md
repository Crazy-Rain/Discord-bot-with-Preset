# Bot Stability Fix - Implementation Summary

## Issue Resolved

**Problem:** Bot occasionally goes offline and stops responding to commands while the web server continues running. Ctrl+C shutdown causes errors.

**Root Cause:** 
- Missing error event handlers for disconnection/errors
- No automatic reconnection logic
- Improper shutdown handling
- Poor cleanup of asyncio resources

## Changes Made

### 1. discord_bot.py - Added Event Handlers

```python
async def on_disconnect(self):
    """Called when bot disconnects from Discord."""
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è  Bot disconnected from Discord. Attempting to reconnect...")

async def on_resume(self):
    """Called when bot resumes connection to Discord."""
    print("‚úÖ Bot reconnected to Discord successfully!")

async def on_error(self, event_method: str, *args, **kwargs):
    """Called when an error occurs in an event handler."""
    import traceback
    print(f"‚ùå Error in {event_method}:")
    print(traceback.format_exc())
```

**Lines added:** 2183-2195

### 2. main.py - Added Imports and Global State

```python
import signal
import sys

# Global flag for graceful shutdown
shutdown_flag = False
```

**Lines modified:** 1-14

### 3. main.py - Implemented Reconnection Logic

```python
async def run_discord_bot(config_manager: ConfigManager):
    """Run the Discord bot with automatic reconnection."""
    global bot_instance, shutdown_flag
    bot_instance = DiscordBot(config_manager)
    token = config_manager.get("discord_token")
    
    if not token or token == "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN":
        print("Error: Discord token not configured!")
        print("Please update config.json with your Discord bot token.")
        print("You can also configure the bot at http://localhost:5000")
        return
    
    # Run bot with automatic reconnection on connection errors
    max_retries = 5
    retry_count = 0
    retry_delay = 5  # seconds
    
    while not shutdown_flag and retry_count < max_retries:
        try:
            await bot_instance.start(token)
            # If we get here, bot stopped normally
            break
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            # Handle graceful shutdown
            break
        except Exception as e:
            retry_count += 1
            if retry_count < max_retries and not shutdown_flag:
                print(f"‚ùå Bot connection error: {e}")
                print(f"üîÑ Retrying in {retry_delay} seconds... (Attempt {retry_count}/{max_retries})")
                await asyncio.sleep(retry_delay)
                # Increase retry delay exponentially (up to 30 seconds)
                retry_delay = min(retry_delay * 2, 30)
            else:
                print(f"‚ùå Bot failed to connect after {max_retries} attempts: {e}")
                raise
    
    # Ensure proper cleanup
    if bot_instance and not bot_instance.is_closed():
        await bot_instance.close()
```

**Lines added:** 26-65

### 4. main.py - Added Signal Handler

```python
def signal_handler(signum, frame):
    """Handle shutdown signals gracefully."""
    global shutdown_flag
    print("\n\nüëã Shutdown signal received. Cleaning up...")
    shutdown_flag = True
    sys.exit(0)
```

**Lines added:** 67-72

### 5. main.py - Updated Main Function

```python
def main():
    """Main function to run both web server and Discord bot."""
    global bot_instance, shutdown_flag
    
    # Register signal handlers for graceful shutdown
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, signal_handler)
    signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, signal_handler)
    
    # ... existing code ...
    
    try:
        # Run bot with reconnection handling
        asyncio.run(run_discord_bot(config_manager))
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        print("\n\nüëã Shutting down...")
    finally:
        # Ensure bot is properly closed
        if bot_instance and not bot_instance.is_closed():
            try:
                # Use a new event loop for cleanup if the main one is closed
                loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
                asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
                loop.run_until_complete(bot_instance.close())
                loop.close()
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error during cleanup: {e}")
```

**Lines modified:** 74-141

   - No manual restart needed for common disconnections
   - Exponential backoff prevents hammering the API

2. **Better Visibility**
   - Clear logging shows connection status
   - Error details help with debugging
   - Event handlers provide real-time feedback

3. **Clean Shutdown**
   - No more errors when pressing Ctrl+C
   - Proper cleanup of all resources
   - Graceful handling of termination signals

4. **Error Recovery**
   - Event handler errors don't crash the bot
   - Full traceback logging for debugging
   - Bot continues running despite errors

## How to Use

1. **Run the bot normally:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Test the improvements:**
   ```bash
   python test_bot_stability.py
   ```

3. **See the demo:**
   ```bash
   python demo_stability_improvements.py
   ```

## Expected Behavior

### On Connection Issues
- Bot detects disconnection
- Logs: `‚ö†Ô∏è  Bot disconnected from Discord. Attempting to reconnect...`
- Automatically retries with delays: 5s ‚Üí 10s ‚Üí 20s ‚Üí 30s ‚Üí 30s
- On success: `‚úÖ Bot reconnected to Discord successfully!`
- After 5 failures: Logs error and stops gracefully

### On Shutdown (Ctrl+C)
- Signal handler catches interrupt
- Logs: `üëã Shutdown signal received. Cleaning up...`
- Closes bot connection properly
- Cleans up resources
- Exits cleanly with no errors

### On Errors
- Event handler errors are caught
- Full traceback is logged
- Bot continues running
- No crash or restart needed

## Conclusion

The bot is now significantly more stable and resilient. It handles disconnections, errors, and shutdowns gracefully, providing a much better user experience with minimal code changes and no breaking changes to existing functionality.
