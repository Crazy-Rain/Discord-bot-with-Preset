# Dynamic Config Updates - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds dynamic configuration updates: API key, proxy, and model changes apply immediately without restart.

**Note**: The bot name change feature previously described in this document has been removed. Characters are now displayed using webhooks with the character's name and avatar, which is more flexible and doesn't have Discord's 32-character nickname limit.

## Changes Made

### 1. Character Display via Webhooks

**Per-channel character loading:**
- Characters are loaded per-channel using the `!character` command
- Webhooks are used to display messages with the character's name and avatar
- This approach avoids nickname length limits and permission issues

### 2. Dynamic Configuration Updates

**discord_bot.py - Added `update_openai_config()` method (lines 51-74):**
```python
def update_openai_config(self, api_key=None, base_url=None, model=None):
    """Update OpenAI client configuration dynamically."""
    # Recreates OpenAI client with new settings
    self.openai_client = OpenAIClient(api_key, base_url, model)
```

**main.py - Modified to share bot instance (lines 9-11, 47-49):**
```python
# Global bot instance accessible to web server
bot_instance = None

# Bot created before web server starts
bot_instance = DiscordBot(config_manager)
web_server = WebServer(config_manager, bot_instance)
```

**web_server.py - Enhanced config update (lines 44-101):**
```python
# Detects OpenAI config changes
if openai_config_changed and self.bot_instance:
    # Applies changes to running bot
    self.bot_instance.update_openai_config(
        api_key=new_api_key,
        base_url=new_base_url,
        model=new_model
    )
```

## Files Modified

1. **discord_bot.py**
   - Removed `update_bot_avatar()` method (no longer needed)
   - Removed bot nickname changing code from `on_ready()` method
   - Character display is now handled via webhooks in `send_as_character()` method

2. **main.py** (+29 lines)
   - Bot instance created early and shared globally
   - Web server receives bot instance reference

3. **web_server.py** (+50 lines)
   - Constructor accepts bot_instance parameter
   - Config endpoint detects and applies OpenAI changes

## Files Added

1. **FEATURE_UPDATE.md** - User documentation (updated to reflect webhook-based character display)
2. **test_new_features.py** - Automated tests for both features (updated)

## Test Results

### Existing Tests (test_bot.py)
```
✓ PASS - Imports
✓ PASS - Configuration
✓ PASS - Presets
✓ PASS - Characters
✓ PASS - OpenAI Client
✓ PASS - Web Server
✓ PASS - Discord Bot
```

### New Feature Tests (test_new_features.py)
```
✓ PASS - Character Loading
✓ PASS - Dynamic Config Update
```

## Usage Examples

### Character Display via Webhooks
```
User: !character luna
Bot: ✨ Loaded character Luna for this channel!
     The bot will now respond with Luna's avatar and name using webhooks.
[Bot responses in this channel appear as "Luna" with Luna's avatar]
```

### Dynamic Config Update
1. Visit http://localhost:5000
2. Navigate to Configuration tab
3. Update API key, base URL, or model
4. Click "Save Configuration"
5. Success: "Configuration updated and applied to running bot"
6. Bot immediately uses new configuration

## Error Handling

### Character Display via Webhooks
- Webhooks handle character name and avatar display
- No nickname length restrictions (unlike bot nicknames limited to 32 chars)
- No special permissions required
- Handles per-channel character assignment
- Works independently in each channel

### Dynamic Config Update
- Validates configuration before applying
- Preserves unchanged values
- Falls back to config file if client values unavailable
- Provides clear success/error messages

## Key Benefits

1. **Zero Downtime**: No restart needed for config changes
2. **Immersive Roleplay**: Character display via webhooks with name and avatar
3. **Development Friendly**: Quick API endpoint switching
4. **Robust**: Comprehensive error handling
5. **Minimal Changes**: Surgical modifications to existing code
6. **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes
7. **No Length Limits**: Webhooks support longer character names than Discord nicknames

## Technical Notes

- Bot instance sharing uses global variable pattern (thread-safe in this context)
- OpenAI client recreation is lightweight and fast
- Character display uses webhooks (per-channel, not global)
- Web server starts before Discord bot for early access
- Config changes persist to file and apply to running instance
- Webhooks allow character names longer than Discord's 32-character nickname limit
