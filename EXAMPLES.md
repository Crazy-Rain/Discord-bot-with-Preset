# Usage Examples

## Basic Usage

### 1. Starting the Bot

```bash
python main.py
```

Output:
```
============================================================
Discord Bot with OpenAI Integration and Preset System
============================================================

üåê Web configuration interface starting at http://localhost:5000
   Configure your bot settings, presets, and character cards through the web UI

ü§ñ Starting Discord bot...
Bot is ready! Logged in as YourBot#1234
```

### 2. Using Discord Commands

#### Chat with the AI
```
!chat Hello, how are you today?
```

Response:
```
Hello! I'm doing great, thank you for asking! I'm here and ready to help you with 
anything you need. How can I assist you today?
```

#### Load a Preset
```
!presets
```

Response:
```
Available presets: creative, analytical
```

```
!preset creative
```

Response:
```
Loaded preset: creative
```

#### Use Character Cards
```
!characters
```

Response:
```
Available characters: luna, sherlock
```

```
!character sherlock
```

Response:
```
Loaded character: sherlock
```

Now chat with Sherlock:
```
!chat I need help solving a mystery
```

Response (in character):
```
Ah, a mystery! Excellent. Tell me everything, and leave no detail out, no matter 
how trivial it may seem. Often, it's the smallest observations that crack the case. 
What precisely is the nature of this mystery?
```

#### Clear Conversation History
```
!clear
```

Response:
```
Conversation history and character names cleared!
```

#### Character Name Tracking (Roleplay)

You can roleplay by identifying yourself as a character using the format `CharacterName: message`.

**Formatting Guidelines:**
- Use `"quotes"` for spoken dialogue
- Use `*asterisks*` for actions
- Plain text for descriptions

Example conversation:
```
!chat Alice: "Hello! Is anyone here?"
```

Response:
```
Hello Alice! Yes, I'm here. How can I help you today?
```

```
!chat Bob: *walks in* "Hey Alice! I just arrived."
```

Response:
```
Welcome, Bob! I see you've just joined Alice. How are you both doing?
```

```
!chat Alice: *turns to Bob* "We're planning an adventure." She pulls out a map
```

Response:
```
Oh, an adventure! That sounds exciting! What kind of adventure are you two planning? 
I can see you have a map there - where are you headed?
```

The bot will track character names (Alice, Bob) and ensure it doesn't pretend to be them.

#### Generate Alternative Responses (Swipe)
```
!chat Tell me a creative story about a robot
```

Response:
```
Once upon a time, there was a curious robot named Bolt who dreamed of becoming an artist...
```

Generate an alternative response:
```
!swipe
```

Response:
```
In a world where machines ruled, one robot named Spark defied its programming to explore poetry...
*Alternative 2/2 (use !swipe_left/!swipe_right to navigate)*
```

Navigate between alternatives:
```
!swipe_left
```

Response:
```
Once upon a time, there was a curious robot named Bolt who dreamed of becoming an artist...
*Alternative 1/2*
```

```
!swipe_right
```

Response:
```
In a world where machines ruled, one robot named Spark defied its programming to explore poetry...
*Alternative 2/2*
```

Generate more alternatives:
```
!swipe
```

Response:
```
Deep in the mechanical gardens, a small bot discovered the beauty of flowers and began painting...
*Alternative 3/3 (use !swipe_left/!swipe_right to navigate)*
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### For Better Responses

1. **Temperature Settings:**
   - 0.1-0.3: Factual, consistent, predictable
   - 0.5-0.7: Balanced, conversational
   - 0.8-1.2: Creative, varied, storytelling
   - 1.3-2.0: Very random, experimental

2. **Token Management:**
   - **Max Tokens (Context)**: The total context window (up to 200,000 for models that support it)
   - **Max Response Length**: The actual response size (recommended: 500-4000 tokens)
   - Short responses: 500-1000 tokens
   - Normal conversation: 1500-2000 tokens
   - Long-form content: 2500-4000 tokens
   - Very long responses: 4000-16000 tokens (requires compatible model)

3. **System Prompts:**
   - Be specific about desired behavior
   - Include formatting instructions
   - Set tone and personality
   - Define constraints and rules

4. **Swipe for Better Responses:**
   - If the AI's first response isn't perfect, use `!swipe` to generate alternatives
   - Keep swiping until you find the response you like
   - Each alternative is saved, so you can navigate back with `!swipe_left`
   - Great for creative writing and roleplay scenarios

### Conversation Management

- Use `!clear` when switching topics or characters
- Keep conversations focused for better context
- Character cards work best with cleared history
- Presets can be changed mid-conversation

### Organizing Presets and Characters

- Name presets by use case: `coding`, `creative`, `analytical`
- Name characters clearly: `detective-holmes`, `assistant-friendly`
- Export important configurations as backups
- Share configurations with teammates via JSON files

## Troubleshooting

### Bot not responding
- Check Discord token is valid
- Ensure bot has message permissions
- Verify MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT is enabled

### API errors
- Check API key and base URL
- Test endpoint accessibility
- Verify model name is correct

### Rate limits
- Reduce message frequency
- Use lower max_tokens
- Consider using local LLM

### Character not working as expected
- Clear conversation history first
- Check system prompt generation
- Verify character fields are filled
- Try using custom system_prompt field
