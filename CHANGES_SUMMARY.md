# Changes Summary

## Problem Statement
1. **404 error when accessing the configuration HTML page** - Web server needed time to fully initialize
2. **Character name tracking feature** - Users wanted to use format `<Character Name>:Words` to identify who is talking in roleplay scenarios

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Web Server Startup Fix (main.py)
**Problem**: Users were getting 404 errors when trying to access http://localhost:5000 immediately after starting the bot.

**Solution**: 
- Added `import time` 
- Added a 2-second delay after starting the web server thread
- Added clear status messages to inform users when the web interface is ready
- Users now see: "‚úÖ Web interface should now be accessible at http://localhost:5000"

**Code Changes**:
```python
# Added delay and clear messaging
time.sleep(2)
print(f"   ‚úÖ Web interface should now be accessible at http://localhost:{port}")
```

### 2. Character Name Tracking (discord_bot.py)
**Problem**: Users wanted to identify themselves as characters using `CharacterName:message` format, and the bot needed to track this without pretending to be those characters.

**Solution**:
- Added regex-based message parsing to extract character names
- Track character names per channel
- Enhance system prompt to inform AI about character names
- Explicitly instruct AI NOT to roleplay as these characters

**Code Changes**:

1. **Added imports**:
```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional, Tuple
import re
```

2. **Added character tracking storage**:
```python
# Track character names per channel for context
self.character_names: Dict[int, List[str]] = {}
```

3. **Added parsing method**:
```python
def parse_character_message(self, message: str) -> Tuple[Optional[str], str]:
    """Parse a message for character name format: 'CharacterName:message'."""
    match = re.match(r'^([^:]+?)\s*:\s*(.+)$', message.strip(), re.DOTALL)
    if match:
        character_name = match.group(1).strip()
        actual_message = match.group(2).strip()
        return character_name, actual_message
    return None, message
```

4. **Updated chat command** to:
   - Parse character names from messages
   - Track new character names
   - Enhance system prompt with character context
   - Format messages with character names in conversation history

5. **Updated clear command** to also clear character names

6. **Enhanced help command** with examples and documentation

### 3. Documentation Updates

**README.md**:
- Added "Character Name Tracking" section with examples
- Updated troubleshooting section for 404 errors
- Updated command descriptions

**CHARACTER_TRACKING.md** (new file):
- Comprehensive guide to the feature
- Usage examples
- Technical details
- Testing instructions

## Testing

All changes have been thoroughly tested:

1. ‚úÖ Existing test suite passes (test_bot.py)
2. ‚úÖ Character name parsing works correctly
3. ‚úÖ Integration test validates conversation flow
4. ‚úÖ Web server starts with clear status messages
5. ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Usage Examples

### Character Name Tracking
```
User: !chat Alice: Hello, how are you today?
Bot: Hello Alice! I'm doing well, thank you. How can I help you?

User: !chat Bob: *waves* Hi Alice! 
Bot: Hello Bob! Welcome! I see you're greeting Alice.
