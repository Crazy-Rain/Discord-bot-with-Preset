# Reconnection and Typing Indicator Fixes

## Problems Solved

### 1. Reconnection Issue
**Problem:** The bot would attempt to reconnect after a connection error, but it would just sit there without actually reconnecting to Discord.

**Root Cause:** Discord.py bot instances cannot be restarted after they have been started and closed/errored. The original code was trying to reuse the same bot instance, which would fail silently.

**Solution:** Create a fresh bot instance for each reconnection attempt. The bot instance is now recreated when:
- The retry count is greater than 0 (indicating a retry)
- The bot instance has been closed

### 2. Typing Indicator Issue
**Problem:** The "User is Typing..." indicator would disappear during long AI responses, leaving users unsure if the bot was still processing their request.

**Root Cause:** Discord's typing indicator (`ctx.typing()`) automatically expires after 10 seconds. If the AI takes longer to respond, the indicator disappears.

**Solution:** Implemented a `PersistentTyping` class that maintains the typing indicator by refreshing it every 8 seconds until the operation completes.

## Implementation Details

### Reconnection Fix (main.py)

```python
async def run_discord_bot(config_manager: ConfigManager):
    # ...
    while not shutdown_flag and retry_count < max_retries:
        try:
            # Create a fresh bot instance for each connection attempt
            if retry_count > 0 or bot_instance.is_closed():
                print("ðŸ”„ Creating fresh bot instance for reconnection...")
                bot_instance = DiscordBot(config_manager)
            
            await bot_instance.start(token)
            # ...
        except Exception as e:
            retry_count += 1
            if retry_count < max_retries and not shutdown_flag:
                # Close the failed bot instance before retrying
                if bot_instance and not bot_instance.is_closed():
                    try:
                        await bot_instance.close()
                    except:
                        pass
                # ...
```

**Key Changes:**
- Creates a new `DiscordBot` instance on each retry
- Properly closes failed instances before retrying
- Ensures clean state for each reconnection attempt

### Persistent Typing Indicator (discord_bot.py)

```python
class PersistentTyping:
    """Context manager that maintains typing indicator for long operations.
    
    Discord's typing indicator expires after 10 seconds. This class refreshes
    it every 8 seconds to maintain a persistent typing indicator during long
    AI responses or operations.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, channel):
        self.channel = channel
        self.task = None
        self.active = False
    
    async def _keep_typing(self):
        """Periodically trigger typing indicator."""
        while self.active:
            try:
                await self.channel.trigger_typing()
                # Wait 8 seconds before refreshing (typing lasts 10 seconds)
                await asyncio.sleep(8)
            except asyncio.CancelledError:
                break
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error maintaining typing indicator: {e}")
                break
    
    async def __aenter__(self):
        """Start the persistent typing indicator."""
        self.active = True
        self.task = asyncio.create_task(self._keep_typing())
        return self
    
    async def __aexit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb):
        """Stop the persistent typing indicator."""
        self.active = False
        if self.task:
            self.task.cancel()
            try:
                await self.task
            except asyncio.CancelledError:
                pass
```

**Usage Example:**
```python
# Before (typing expires after 10 seconds)
async with ctx.typing():
    response = await openai_client.chat_completion(...)

# After (typing persists for entire operation)
async with PersistentTyping(ctx.channel):
    response = await openai_client.chat_completion(...)
```

**Key Features:**
- Automatically refreshes typing indicator every 8 seconds
- Properly cleans up the background task when done
- Handles errors gracefully
- Works as a drop-in replacement for `ctx.typing()`

## Testing

The fixes include comprehensive tests in `test_fixes.py`:

1. **Reconnection Tests:**
   - Verifies fresh bot instances are created on retry
   - Confirms failed instances are properly closed

2. **Typing Indicator Tests:**
   - Verifies `PersistentTyping` class exists and has correct structure
   - Tests that typing indicator is triggered and refreshes
   - Confirms all `ctx.typing()` usages have been replaced

Run tests with:
```bash
python3 test_fixes.py
```

## Impact

### For Users:
- **Better Reliability:** Bot will successfully reconnect after connection issues
- **Better UX:** Typing indicator now stays visible during long AI responses
- **Peace of Mind:** Users can see the bot is still working on their request

### For Developers:
- **Cleaner State:** Fresh bot instances ensure no state contamination
- **Better Error Recovery:** Proper cleanup before retries
- **Maintainable Code:** `PersistentTyping` can be reused anywhere typing is needed
